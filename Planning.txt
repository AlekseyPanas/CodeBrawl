1. Generate World
2. Await connections and initial player setup data (Player modules, etc)
3. Enable start button after at least 2 connections
4. Start button begins game

1. Send data to all connected clients (locations of all players, locations of items, locations of physics hitboxes)
2. Await responses from all clients (Packet Structure)
3. If client disconnects, kill their player

---------------------

Player Stats/ Setup:

- Each player is a circle
- Each player has a circle radius comprised of "modules"
    - Health module = +5 HP / 1 radius
    - Force = +.1x bullet speed / 1 radius
    - Dodge = +2% Dodge chance / 1 radius
    - Damage = +.05x damage mult / 1 radius
    - Speed = +0.1x speed mult / 1 radius
    - Energy = +10 max starting energy and capacity / 1 radius
    - Sword Length = +3px sword length / 1 radius
- Each player starts by default with a radius of 4 comprised of health modules
- Max radius is 30
- Each player by default starts with full energy capacity at 100 energy
- Each player starts with 50 bullets
- Each player has a sword


During the game:
- With each tick, player chooses:
    - Movement (Left, Up, Down, Right) --> They can move in 2 directions in one tick,
    and can specify a slower speed than normal.
        - Movement takes away energy based on distance moved
        - If player has no energy, max speed is half of normal
    - Shoot (Angle, projectile) / (Target, Homing_missile)
        - Projectile speed will be calculated by multiplying the projectile's default speed
        by the player's Force multiplier
    - Sword (Angle)
        - Sword will extend instantly and will linger for 5 ticks dealing a single
        large damage hit in the direction of the attack to all enemies that it hits
        - Sword attack cannot be repeated until it is retracted

Environment:
- Energy will spawn in the map (+25 energy per item)
- Bullets will spawn in packs (+20 bullets)
- High Velocity bullets will spawn in packs (+5 bullets)
    - 3x as fast as regular bullets
- Homing missiles (+1 missile)
    - .5x as fast as normal bullets, follows given target
- Stun Grenade (+1 grenade)
    - Cancels incoming commands from players within explosion radius for 30 ticks
- Box obstacles in environment that randomly spawn. Boxes absorb bullets and cannot be moved through
- No leaving screen bounds
